The **Joint Socio-Economic Metabolism (SEM) Section Conference and the Asia-Pacific (AP) Conference of the International Society for Industrial Ecology (ISIE)** will focus on topics related to **both methodological development and sustainability implications of industrial ecology and socio-economic metabolism research**, including but not limited to resource efficiency, circular economy, resource security, food systems, built environment, urban metabolism, waste management, climate change mitigation, global value chains, embodied environmental impacts, stock-flow-service nexus, and renewable energy and low-carbon transition.

We look forward to welcoming as many of you as possible from the ISIE, ISIE-SEM, and ISIE-AP families. We also aim to bring together researchers from related fields such as geography, urban planning, climate change, and environmental system engineering and practitioners from industry and policy arena.

This integrated event of the ISIE-SEM and ISIE-AP will be a unique combination and opportunity to discuss industrial ecology and socio-economic metabolism issues facing the Asia-Pacific region and the world surrounding it. It will also be a platform for collaboration among scholars, practitioners, and policy-makers across the world to make a lasting contribution to this field.
